**Educational static site generator in Logo.**

Learn programming while building websites. The turtle draws your layouts.

== Who Is This For?

* **Logo programmers** returning to a beloved language
* **Educators** teaching programming concepts visually
* **Anyone learning to code** who wants practical projects
* **Nostalgic developers** from the Apple II era

== Why terrapin-ssg?

=== Visual Programming

Watch the turtle draw your site layouts. Abstract concepts become tangible patterns.

=== Beginner-Friendly Syntax

Commands read like instructions: FORWARD 100, RIGHT 90. No cryptic syntax to decode.

=== Recursive Design

Logo's recursive procedures naturally create complex, beautiful patterns from simple rules.

=== Generative Art

Every page can include unique turtle-generated SVG artwork. Your site literally draws itself.
